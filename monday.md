# order from disorder by piers colman

+ "fluctuation induce hamiltonian"
+ Love triangles
+ kagome lattice
+ windmill afm
+ order from disorder:anti-dote to mernin wagner theorem
+ large scale MC
+ Z_2 -> Z_p ???
+ p>=5 -> p-fold anisotropy becomes irrelevant (Jose,77)
+ low T -> 6 fold anisotropy, higher -> Coplanarity, higher T -> decoupled sublattices.

## bob
+ lab model
+ stick-slip dynamics
+ granular shear dynamics
+ fracture mechanics
+ friction or fracture?

## susan lehman (interesting)
+ a pile of dry particles (no cohesion) -> max cohesion by oil
+ (see) gscaling collapse of avalanche size distribution.
+ no cohesion vs. max cohesion ( fewer but larger avalanche)

no cohesion | max cohesion
---|---
no cohesion 1.5 power law | larger than 1.5 power law with tail

+ waiting time longer after large avalanche

## by johnson group
+ bulk metallic glasses
+ pure shear scalar: k(r) = cos(4\theta)/r^2
+ loading isn't always pure shear
+ fully tensorial simulations
+ avalanche shape: mft parabola, simulaiton: deviation
+ QA: whether number of small events are subextensive??? distance between small events?
